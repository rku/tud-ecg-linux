tud-ecg-linux
=============

Linux buildfiles and patches for exercise tasks of the "Introduction to
Computer Graphics" course at the Dresden University of Technology.
If you do not know what this is, you probably do not need it.

Even though developing in linux works very well for the course, you should
always check your code within MSVC (in a virtual machine for example) before
uploading it for rating.
